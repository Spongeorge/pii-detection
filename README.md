# Personally Identifiable Information Detection
Repository for my final project in  DTSA 5511 Introduction to Deep Learning at CU Boulder

In this project I fine-tune DeBERTa (a variant of the BERT Transformer language model) on the token classification task of PII Detection, specifically on educational data.

PII Detection is important in the educational setting to be able to anonymize student assignments, either for peer review, or to enable the publication of real-world educational datasets which would benefit academic research, industrial applications, and educators themselves.
